## Opening the assignment 

Create a folder for the project, and change (cd) into that folder.

Run the following commands
- git init -b main
- git remote add origin [Your project repository URL]
- git remote -v // This verifies the remote connection between your local repo and GitHub
- git pull origin main // This will clone the repository on your local machine

To push the code you write to GitHub so it will be graded, run these commands
- git add . // This will flag any changed files to be uploaded
- git commit -m "Your update comment here" // Change "Your update comment here" to describe what changes you've made.
- git push origin main // Push the changes you've made up to GitHub
